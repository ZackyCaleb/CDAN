The official code repository for the paper "Self-Supervised Facial Expression Parsing: Unveiling Global Patterns through Facial Action Units."


* First Step
  * Please set your environment following the requirements.


* First Step
  * Please download related datasets from [Affectnet](http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/), [Oulu-CASIA](https://www.oulu.fi/en), and [KDEF](http://www.emotionlab.se/kdef/). Meanwhile, please use [Openface toolkit](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace) to get the segment faces and facial action units of these images. Finally, allocate the training and testing datasets and place them under folder datasets.


* Second Step
  * Run main.py by setting related parameters.
